# Mathematics LaTeX Templates and Papers

## Skeleton

The skeleton folder contains a basic outline for a mathematics paper written in LaTeX. The standard.sty file contains standard mathmode shorthands for common objects as well as formatting of titles, sections, subsections, tocs, and bibliographys. The refs.bib file should contain bibliography references. Since standard.sty contains some unicode characters that cannot be compiled with **pdfLaTeX**, main.tex needs to be compiled with **XeLaTeX** or **LuaLaTeX**.

## Papers

This contains the TeX files for my publically available mathematics research papers and lecture notes. I cannot guarantee correctness of any material contained
in these papers but you are welcome to contact me if there is a glaring issue that needs attention.
