\maketitle
This problem set is due Friday, January 31 at 5PM on Gradescope. Feel
free to discuss the problems with whoever you wish, but make sure
that the writing for your submission is entirely your own. As with
all assignments and exams in this course, unless stated otherwise,
you must prove your answers. You may use without proof anything proved
in the required reading (though you must clearly state what facts
you use).

Some of the problems may have \emph{hints}, which may be helpful for
solving the problem, \emph{remarks,} which give some extra context,
and \emph{bonuses}, which are optional, count for 0 points, and will
only be use to effect grades on the boundary (e.g., help determine
A+ grades), but are potentially interesting. It is possible to ignore
these hints, remarks, and bonuses and still obtaining a full score.

\section*{Problem 1 {[}10 Points{]}: Directing an Undirected Graph}

Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph and $\mu\in\Z_{>0}^{V}$. We
say that $G$ is \emph{$\mu$-orientable }if we can replace each undirected
$\{u,v\}\in E$ with one of $(u,v)\in E$ or $(v,u)\in E$ such that
that $\mathrm{deg}_{\mathrm{out}}(u)\defeq|\{(u,v)\in E\}|$ satisfies
$\mathrm{deg}_{\mathrm{out}}(u)\leq\mu(u)$ for each $u\in V$. Provide
a polynomial time algorithm that given $G$ and $\mu$ provably outputs
whether or not $G$ is $\mu$-orientable.
\begin{shaded}
SOLUTION: 
\end{shaded}

\textbf{Bonus:} Prove that $G$ is $\mu$-orientable if and only if
$|F|\leq\mu(V(F))$ holds for all $F\subseteq E$, where $V(F)$ is
the set of endpoints of $F$ and $\mu(S)\defeq\sum_{v\in S}\mu(v)$.

\section*{Problem 2 {[}20 Points{]}: Vertex Disjoint Path}

Provide an $O(m\sqrt{n})$ time algorithm that given a strongly connected
$n$-node $m$-edge directed graph $G=(V,E)$ and vertices $s$ and
$t\in V$ with $s\neq t$ computes a set of vertex-disjoint (other
than $s$ and $t$) $s$-$t$ paths of maximum size (in terms of the
number of paths).

\section*{Problem 3 {[}10 Points{]}: Restricted Simple Path}

Provide an $O(m)$ time algorithm that given a connected undirected
graph $G=(V,E)$ with $m=|E|$ and three nodes, $u,v,w\in V$ outputs
a simple path from $u$ to $w$ passing through $v$ (provided one
exists).\\
